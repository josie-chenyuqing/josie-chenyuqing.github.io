        <p>“Things I have Been Silent About: Memories” is a purely autobiographical account of the author’s family and friends, and of the tumultuous times she lived through in Iran. In this book, silent matters encompass victims, families and countries. Dictators want more power by keeping the masses quiet, rewriting history and stealing the day; Witnesses remain silent, do not want to see the world ugly to say, to maintain the surface of the hypocrisy of nothing happened; The silence of the victim leads them to feel guilty, making them an accomplice to the person who hurt them.</p>
<p>There is so much silence, so much that it covers the whole of Iran and fills every nook and cranny of Nafisi’s childhood.</p>
<p>Nafisi’s assault made her feel painful and fearful for a long time. When she grew up and wanted to overcome her fear, she found that she had to break the silence. Silence, not choosing to speak out about the experience of being violated, is actually a compromise to the crime.</p>
<p>But what could she have done as a child? The perpetrator was a respectable man, and Nafisi felt his parents would not believe him.</p>
<p>In order to meet her mother’s expectations, she began a failed marriage, in the eyes of others for her happiness is shackled. She had the pleasure of going abroad to learn new ideas, to learn about independence from revolution, and she began to yearn for the independence of her country, but she could not change her life.</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue</strong>: After the Islamic Revolution, I realized how fragile our existence in this world is, your comforting home, your sense of self, your sense of identity, belonging, everything can be taken away from you at any time. From the stories my father taught me, I learned to create a home in my own world, a home that has nothing to do with geography, nationality, or anything else that can be taken away from me, that no one can take away from me. But these stories do not lessen the pain of losing my parents; Nor do they provide comfort and live to an end. It wasn’t until after they died that I realized that each, in their own way, had given me a mobile home. This home protects my memories and continues to help me resist the brutality inflicted upon us by man and time.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt</strong>: In the memoir, my father describes a form of paedophilia that was prevalent in Iranian society. The paedophilia is mainly caused by “the prohibition of contact between men and women. “Adolescent males have no access to any women except their mothers, sisters, aunts,” he argues. “Most mental disorders are rooted in sexual deprivation.” He goes on to explain that this bias is not confined to the Catholic community.</p>
<p>I can’t be as generous as my father. Intellectually I can understand the complexity - I know that marrying a nine-year-old girl is normal at some point, not taboo. Within certain boundaries, hypocrisy is not a vice, but a way to survive. But that did not comfort me, nor did it remove my sense of shame. I am glad that social, ethnic and legal traditions can be changed, so we will no longer burn women as witches, no longer have slaves, no longer stone people to death; You know, our mothers can care more about their children, they can protect them from paedophiles. My generation was in the dawn of that transition. His way of life had become taboo, just as marriage between first Cousins, once normal in ancient society, had been forbidden by law.</p>
<p>It was at Haji Agha’s that I received my first and most painful injury. Other similar injuries are more likely to be unintentional and easier to forget. But they invariably made me feel ashamed, angry and hopeless. I couldn’t tell my parents because they were adults just like pedophiles. His mother obeyed and respected him so much. Will they trust me, or Will they trust Haji Agha? As I got older, I learned to put the experience in a larger context, to distance myself from it. I look at it as a social illness, not as a personal experience. This had a somewhat therapeutic effect: I felt a little more powerful in the face of unchangeable social reality. I also began to understand that what I was going through was happening all over the world, not just to me; Knowing that there is a little boy or girl in New York or Baghdad who has the same secret as me. It was both comforting and disturbing but it didn’t completely cure the pain and confusion of the experience and I kept quiet about it for a long time. I have never written about Haji Agha in my diary, although I have recalled the experience again and again in my mind, so that all the details are still fresh in my mind. (p62)</p>
<p>Sometimes people think that it’s not appropriate to put paedophiles or children being sexually abused in the context of sexual abuse, because children may not even know what’s going on. But I think it’s necessary because children can understand the damage that an abuser can do, and know that sometimes their own truth is hard to believe. If it’s a teacher, if it’s a white collar, if it’s a good-looking elite, the kids can’t help it, because they don’t know that anyone will trust them.</p>

        <p><strong>This film is included in my thematic study. But because girls who are sexually abused in the film are used as leads, it was not included in the study.</strong><br><strong>I want to recommend this film to more people, to make people understand justice and love.</strong></p>
<p>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing</p>
<p>After watching the film, I found that the girl received sexual assault is only a trigger, which is the theme throughout the film, the beginning and end of the mother’s revenge.</p>
<p>The story takes place in a remote town, where Mill’s daughter is raped and murdered, but the local police do nothing, so the angry mother rents three billboards in the town to reveal the useless sheriff, hoping to let sheriff Willoughby continue to investigate the criminal.</p>
<p>Mother Mill is an independent female hero, because her daughter’s death is indirectly caused by her, so she vowed to find the murderer. She is eloquent, has a strong thinking ability, and has a very strong personality, but it is precisely because of such excessive sensibility that she will do extremely irrational things.</p>
<p>Constable Dixon has a strong propensity for violence and the same emotional disregard for things that should be used mentally. He seems to be the archetypal bad guy, mambo, racist, and closet.</p>
<p>Sheriff Willoughby is the most rational person in the play. He has the emotional part, but he has a heavy view of the big picture and will consider the possible result first. Although he is foul-mouthed, he has been working for the townsfolk. His terminal cancer makes him feel inadequate to deal with mill’s daughter’s case.</p>
<p>The play USES several threes, three billboards put up by Mill, three letters left by Willoughby after his suicide, three members of the leading group, and three outbreaks of conflict. Together, they explain good and evil, and justice in the eyes of ordinary people. The rape case is an imprint that brings out the pursuit of so-called justice among people of different classes.</p>
<p>At first, Mill thinks that both the murderer and the police are evil. They represent the evil men who rape and kill women and the bourgeoisie who look on coldly. Then the priest and dentist who spoke for the sheriff became accomplices – because they and the police belonged to a “group,” a group of bystanders with no help or empathy. However, as the story progresses, her attitude towards the police changes, and she feels guilty for her aggressiveness and insubordination. At this time, the image of the police in her heart changes to some extent.</p>
<p>The evil in Dixon’s eyes is first the reactionary Mill, and then the advertiser who helps Mill for money. His good idea comes from his boss Dixon, when Dixon dies of suicide, his anger and despair make him beat the advertiser, and then he is fired by the new sheriff.</p>
<p>The second conflict of the story is the death of Willoughby, the cancer is about to destroy him completely, so he shot his own life, from the cloth covering his head to ask his family not to open it and put flowers beside the left letter can be seen that he is a very sensitive man. He left three letters to his wife, Mill and Dixon, and it was these letters that changed the character’s conception of good and evil.</p>
<p>The letter to Mill explains that in a very emotional move, he helped her pay for the next month’s advertisement and encouraged her not to give up on finding the murderer, saying that he was sorry he had not found the prisoner.<br>Then billboards are burned, what glimmers of hope are extinguished, and Mill, in his agony, torches the police station.</p>
<p>The third conflict was in the burning police station, where Dixon was reading Willoughby’s letter. He understood the sheriff’s painstaking efforts at this time, in the fire to save mill’s daughter’s scroll. Obviously, he knows that Mill started the fire, but instead of using violence to solve the problem, he wants to do something for Mill’s daughter with a last bit of kindness.</p>
<p>The last little man, a retired soldier with a cheeky smile, was the only one in the whole play who was as bad as his bones. He bragged in the bar about raping and killing girls, and even came to mock Mill after seeing the billboard, wishing he were the devil who raped and killed her daughter. Although Dixon’s hard-won cortical tissue shows that the soldier was in Iraq at the time of the crime, his actions cannot be forgiven, so at the end, Mill and Dixon, two enemies, finally put aside their prejudices and decide to go together to find the soldier.<br>It’s an open ending. They may or may not be outlaws who kill soldiers.</p>
<p> No matter what, justice is always there.</p>

        <p>conclusion</p>
<ol>
<li>Definition of endangered animals:<br>Author: Baozhu Taoist<br>Link: <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/373594404/answer/1114916666" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.zhihu.com/question/373594404/answer/1114916666</a><br>Source: Zhihu<br>Endangered animals refer to all wildlife species that are in danger of extinction due to their own reasons or by human activities or natural disasters. They generally refer to rare, endangered or rare wild animals. From the perspective of wildlife management, endangered animals refer to the animals listed in the appendix of cites and the wildlife under special national and local protection [1]. Endangered animals are divided into two grades according to China’s standards for animals under state protection, which are based on a comprehensive assessment and demonstration of the scientific value, economic value, amount of resources, degree of endangerment and whether they are unique to China. Classified as Class I, it refers to rare or endangered wild animals found in China. Class II refers to wild animals that are rare in number, narrow in distribution and in danger of extinction. 2. Classification standard of endangered animals [1] : safe: although there is a threat, it is not serious at present. “Low concern” does not mean that the species has received little attention, but that the threat is not serious enough to be of undue concern. For example: Taiwan blue magpie, Wolf. Near danger: When a taxon does not meet the criteria of extremely dangerous, endangered, or vulnerable, but is close to meeting or likely to meet the threat level after a period of time. For example, small heads sleep sharks, rabbits. Vulnerable: There may be a relatively high threat of extinction in the medium term. Examples: ring-tailed lemurs, great white sharks, polar bears. Endangered: Wild populations face a high probability of extinction in the near future. For example: the blue whale, the panda. Critically endangered: The risk of imminent extinction of wild populations is very high. Examples: milu deer, Taiwan salmon. Extinction in the wild: a taxon is considered extinct in the wild when it lives only in cultivated, captive conditions, or as a naturalized population (or population) living far from its former habitat. For example: Dromedary, Taiwan sika deer. Extinction: A taxon is considered extinct if there is reason to suspect that the last individual of the taxon is dead. For example: Thylacine, dodo bird, Taiwan clouded leopard.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br>2. Survival status of endangered animals<br>In recent centuries, thousands of species of wild animals and plants have become extinct in the world, among which 150 species of birds, 95 species of beasts and 80 species of amphibians and reptiles have become extinct since the 16th century. Statistics from the International Union for conservation of Nature show that 5 percent to 20 percent of vertebrate and tree species are now threatened with extinction. Of the more than 100 vertebrates in danger of extinction worldwide, about 14 are the result of natural evolution. The rest is due to human factors. Many wild animals in China are endangered, such as red-crowned cranes, Chinese alligators, giant pandas and South China tigers. So it is urgent to protect habitats and restore damaged ecosystems. According to reliable research, the world disappears one kind of animal about every hour and one kind of creature about every minute.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Reasons for the emergence of endangered animals<br>1) Chinese demand for game is increasing. In the south, where the game market is very dense, 53 snake species are brought to the table in China and three quarters of the freshwater turtle population has sharply decreased. From 2007 to 2016, 209 pangolin smuggling cases were detected in China, including 2,405 live pangolins and 11,419 dead ones.</li>
</ol>
<p>2) Parts of wild animals that can be made into medicine or fur coats, such as ivory and antlers, are so valuable that even under strict laws, a steady flow of poachers go to major reserves to kill rare animals.</p>
<p>3) Pollution caused by human production and continuous reclamation of new land will destroy the habitat of wild animals, thus leading to the emergence of endangered animals.<br>Such as:<br>(1) The star-nosed mole feeds on worms and earthworms, which have certain requirements on soil fertility. Because human beings do not carry out garbage classification, they also throw electronic waste randomly, which leads to the gradual spread of toxic substances in the land. Earthworms, worms and other worms cannot survive, while the number of star-nose-mole has decreased sharply in recent years due to the lack of food.<br>(2) The survival of the baiji is also under threat. Garbage in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River is piled up at will on the river bank, and garbage from ships is discharged into the river at will. In recent years, construction garbage and chemical garbage are dumped along with the waste liquid, making the Yangtze River water seriously polluted and threatening the survival of the Baiji dolphin.<br>(3) The hawksbill turtle population has declined sharply. Coral reefs, where these creatures live, have been decimated by human waste and ozone depletion<br>4). Endangered animals like China’s giant panda, with low fertility and harsh living conditions (bamboo is a staple food), are already in decline. The natural enemies of endangered animals either increase in Numbers due to overproduction by humans, or they have less food (plants) to survive on<br>The South China tiger is the most endangered of all tiger species. Living in south-central China, it is estimated that there are only 20-30 south China tigers left in the wild in the world. There are now 47 south China tigers in 18 Chinese zoos around the world. Zoos can only breed in captivity</p>
<p>There are loopholes in the national law that many rare animals are not listed for protection</p>
<p>Sentiment: human really love an animal, is not in its dying time to give it a comfortable grave, but at the beginning of the protection, so that they can be healthy reproduction.<br>The existence of human beings in a sense is to interfere with the “wild growth” of animals and plants, pollution caused by human factories, poachers who want expensive fur among human beings, wherever there is a market and interest, animals are gradually endangered. The bad influence of human on animals will come back to bite us in the future. The rupture of the food chain will lead to the extinction of more and more animals and the destruction of the ecological balance. Eventually, human beings will become animals unable to resist extinction</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What can man do to protect endangered animals:<br>1) Let children know about all kinds of wild animals from childhood, and popularize relevant concepts from kindergarten. Deepen the impression through pictures, let them understand that the survival of endangered animals is closely related to the fate of mankind, and cultivate the concept of animal protection for children from childhood<br>Let the children go to the zoo to have close contact with the animals. The teacher or the zookeeper will teach the children about the animals</li>
</ol>
<p>2) Streaming stars shoot movies with real scenes to arouse more people’s empathy and refuse fur products</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><p>Increase nature reserves in the suburbs, expand the scale of volunteers and patrols, and add armed personnel</p>
</li>
<li><p>The state funds the development of science and technology to improve the fertility rate and the survival rate of endangered animals</p>
</li>
</ol>

        <p>Strange consumer psychology</p>
<ol>
<li>The higher the price, the better to sell – Vanity effect (Egret Effect)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1950 Harvey Leibenstein, an American economist, published the vanity effect and its corresponding conformity effect.</p>
<p>Rich people generally do not like the public to imitate their consumption behavior, because they want to be different when they buy goods. To put it simply, the vanity effect is the tendency to pursue high-grade goods.</p>
<p>Specific manifestations of vanity effect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy high-end products quickly when they first come on the market.</li>
<li>Stop buying once its market share reaches a level that the general public can consume.</li>
</ol>
<p>The higher the goods are, the more they are consumed by individuals, the more obvious the vanity effect is. If it is not mainly for personal consumption, and the goods are purchased for external display, even if the price is high, the higher the price, the more the demand will increase the herd effect.</p>
<p>If it is believed that vanity effect is more likely to occur in the target market, marketing policies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay more attention to the lifetime value of a product than its market share. That is to say, in the choice of market strategy, focus on maintaining the original customers, because if only focus on the immediate interests and focus on market expansion and ignore the original customers, one day even the original customers will leave. Moreover, at some point, the marketing strategy must not only stop expanding new users, it must also do demarketing to prevent the influx of new users.</li>
<li>Absolutely avoid price competition. Cutting prices creates two problems. The general public, which is sensitive to price, will buy the product after the price has been lowered<br>(1) Reduce the scarcity of commodities, leading to the departure of existing customers<br>(2) The deterioration of commodity quality.</li>
<li>As a late entrant, try to avoid business promotions such as “me too”. Because markets with a vanity effect seem to have good yields and few competitors.<br>When a new competitor enters the market, the market itself may collapse. The participation of new competitors will increase consumption, but the original customers may choose to leave the market because of the vanity effect. The original business had already enjoyed high profits, so it could recoup its investment costs, while the new competitors could only suffer huge losses.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Big Spending Saves the Economy – Paradox of Thrift<br>If you consume more than your income, you have no way to save, and you end up living in poverty. So we work hard to be rich, and sometimes we become stingy, trying to save more money.<br>This is true for individuals, but bad for the economy as a whole.<br>Can the country really become richer if all its citizens become stingy? The answer is no, especially in a bad economy. Let’s see why.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the economy goes into recession, people will save more and consume less because they are worried about the future. But if everyone consumes less, business sales will fall and inventories will increase. As a result, companies can only reduce production and employment, and their employees’ income will decrease. Worries about the future will intensify, people will become more determined to spend less and save more, and the economy as a whole will be trapped in a downward spiral.<br>This leads to the paradox that saving is reasonable from an individual’s point of view, but not economically as a whole. This is called the Paradox of Thrift. If businesses cannot increase their consumption, the government should also step in to increase government spending by offering preferential terms for enterprises to invest and make efforts to attract foreign investors and tourists to increase investment and consumption. Only in this way can a virtuous circle be formed and the economy eventually get better.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Free is not always good – Free Economics<br>“There is no such thing as a free lunch” was Milton Friedman, the famous economist who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1976<br>Some information may seem free at first glance, but in fact it doesn’t mean free at all. Or it can be interpreted as some kind of lure behind free, or it can be interpreted as not expecting something free at no cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gradually, however, the case for true free is gaining ground. Just as bad money drives out good, the trend towards free eviction fees is reinforced. The Economist, a British newspaper, looked ahead to 2008 and named the trend “freeconomics”, combining the words “free” and “economics” to form a new word.</p>
<p>Look around us and you’ll find a lot of free marketing, including the free newspaper in front of the subway station. Free newspapers, which once threatened dailies and sports newspapers, have large readership and are highly profitable from advertising. Less popular freeshees would be pushed out of business because they could not generate enough advertising revenue, so that the surviving freeshees could gradually occupy more favorable positions. The richer the company, the more likely it is to survive the free competition. Therefore, consumers may also face losses caused by monopoly.<br>However, another drawback of free markets is the waste of resources. Free newspapers, for example, waste a lot of newsprint because they are given away free to consumers. A system of mass production and mass consumption can lead to an overuse of energy and lead to an acceleration of global warming.</p>

        <p>I think freedom is a profound word. A lot of people do. Their childhood is the most free, but the truth is that people have never been free, they need to do a lot of things, need to follow the rules at all times, according to the established procedures. Similarly, students and employees have become the victims of surveillance and failed education under the evolving air system.<br>In fact, the purpose of using AI to monitor students’ learning is good. Parents and teachers hope to make students more obedient in this way, improve students’ learning efficiency, and enable students to get better grades so as to obtain a better future. It’s true, but it never occurred to them that it destroyed the students’ ability to have fun, deprived them of the joy they should have had at this age, and forced them to put on a false mask and live like robots. Sure, they may do well in the future, they will become excellent people, but they have lost their creativity forever, lost the joyful power to laugh freely, and they are all prisoners. Sink in the cage of the classroom.<br>For them, youth is a distant word of beauty.</p>
<p>However, to some extent, the AI monitoring system not only fails to help them, but also distorts their psychology. They can feel the intense pressure all the time, and they have to learn. They go to school not just for the sake of their own interests, but for the sake of a future job, a job they don’t even know what it is. This kind of learning, though efficient, is undoubtedly useless. They may go to jobs they hate and do things they don’t like in the future, but they have no choice, or they have no choice at all.<br>It’s not just a school problem, it’s a society problem. It’s like amazon spying on employees. It seems that what society wants is only machines that can work for it and contribute all their strength to its process, rather than living human beings. Human beings are called human beings because we have a variety of emotions, we feel sad and angry, we do whatever we want to do, we think and think.<br>And what is a machine? It’s emotionless, it’s fake, it’s not real. He will act according to the procedures given to him, not out of his own will. There is a big difference between the two. If the AI system is to continue to develop and enter every household, the situation will be deteriorated. Who knows if what you do will end up in some file? If it goes on like this, there will be no further development of human beings, because all their sense of innovation has been completely wiped out.</p>

        <p>Super carrier Reagan </p>
<p>Great engineering campaign, the title is the highest praise for the aircraft carrier! America’s technological prowess is truly admirable. Super carrier Ronald Reagan is the most advanced nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and single weapon in the world. It is also the first aircraft carrier commissioned by the United States in the 21st century. It operates in international waters and in American territory, with aircraft, weapons and a fine navy of 5, 000, ready to be there when it is needed (often for long-distance transport).The Reagan is the uss nimitz-class aircraft carrier 9, built by the United States in the late 1990s, and named after Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States. Reagan, the first former US President to name a navy ship while still alive, died a year after the carrier began service. Since then, the carrier has become a symbol of the President, following Reagan’s motto of “strength for peace”. This is indeed a viable idea. Powerful combat weapons patrolling the sea, especially in conflict zones, can enhance the country’s deterrence and highlight America’s military strength. The ship is 332.85 meters long, 78.34 meters wide, has a deck area of 18,000 square meters, displaces 97,000 tons of water, rises 20 stories above the waterline, stands as high as the Empire State Building and can reach speeds of 35 miles per hour. The ship carries 85 aircraft of various types and can accommodate 6,000 crew members. Equipped with two nuclear reactor engines, the Reagan can run continuously for 20 years without refueling. The ship has enough food to feed 6,000 soldiers for three months. The service period is 50 years. Equipped with all the latest technology, the carrier can house 85 fighter jets at a cost of $4.5 billion. The Ronald Reagan is not a zero anymore, it’s a great project. As long as authorized by the President of the United States, personnel can deploy the carrier’s battle group anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>Along with the high technology of the Reagan is the caution of the personnel involved, whose work is both a glory and a constraint. This is also the most dangerous working environment. The soldiers are trained in the most rigorous way, and no small mistakes that might lead to disaster are allowed. At the heart of the operation was the 400 crew on deck, who had to follow the flow of the jet engines, and the first lesson was to put up with the noise. Others, such as aircraft controllers, need to coordinate their work, fold up the aircraft, put it in the right place, and stretch the limited space to the limit. At the same time, maintenance and oil is also an essential link, work is extremely busy, often need to do two things at once, both sides have to grasp, always tracking the dynamics of each aircraft. Frequent landings lead to busy ground crews shuttling back and forth at a controlled time. The master maneuvers this most delicate instrument, like a perfect ballet. In order to ensure the safety of personnel and distinguish the work of various departments, the soldiers changed into rainbow clothing to ensure bright colors, so as to quickly identify the crew.</p>
<p>Without the longest runway, the crew USES wind and propellers to help the plane take off, allowing it to accelerate for a short time. Landing was even riskier, reaching speeds of up to 150 miles per hour before landing, and landing on a mother ship that swayed with the waves was even more difficult, with constant and deadly pressure. At this point, partners need to cooperate, measure the Angle of the landing, to ensure that the blocking line hook, this is the end of a landing.</p>
<p>The following is the question of supplies. The Reagan is powered by two nuclear reactors at the bottom, which work with turbine engines and provide enough power to power a city of 100,000 people. The equipment can run for 20 years, but the weekly replenishment (supplies, fuel, parts) on board is essential. The ships must maintain a constant speed and a safe distance of 160 feet for three to six hours. First, a rope was thrown to transport pallets of supplies, then fuel was added through a hose. The safety team is particularly important here, keeping an eye on the process in case one of the crew’s clothes gets hooked or the locks snap.</p>
<p>To sum up, we can accuse the United States of inhumanity in other places, but the United States is the undisputed king of technology, as evidenced by the super carrier Ronald Reagan and the supporting fighter system. The hope is that the carrier, like its motto, will exist to protect peace, not to threaten other countries by force.</p>

        <p>Generation War</p>
<p>In war, the people come first, then the nation, then the country. So all the talk of war is about people.<br>World war ii is too vague a topic, but the film from the perspective of five different types of German youth, in a small stage show the cruelty of war.<br>Five people, five choices, five experiences, and five endings.<br>Five young men. A pair of brothers, a mature and steady brother and a timid brother, a female nurse who has just passed the examination, a young woman who works in a bar and a Jew.<br>The two brothers joined the army, and the nurse went to the field hospital. A few good friends then celebrated the night before they left and agreed to get together again at Christmas. They were laughing and having fun, defying curfews. They feel fearless, too optimistic about war and too simplistic about human nature.<br>One of the great little details of the miniseries is that it marks the distance from Berlin before it gets anywhere. This corresponds to the young people saying “see you in Berlin at Christmas” before saying goodbye.<br>On July 10, 1941, the battle of Leningrad began.<br>First, the brothers, who went to opposite extremes.<br>Brother will ham is the main narrator of the film, which opens as a second lieutenant in greyhound company. He was a typical German, fearless and eager to give his country everything he had. Full of passion and energy, he is always the center of the crowd and a strategic leader. In his mind, war makes men mature.<br>His strength came from his belief that Hitler could lead Germany to a brighter future. So at first he looked down upon his brother who wanted to escape the war.<br>But as the battle lines stretched, from 1941 to 1943, will began to wonder what he was fighting for. He discovered the nature of war, he knew it was wrong. He could not answer to the germans or the soviets, nor could he confide in his soldiers. In the end, he became the deserter he had most hated.<br>Then will found the meaning of life – to live. He can’t be a hero, and he doesn’t want to be a pig in a slaughterhouse.<br>In contrast to his emotional brother, brother Fred hamm is so rational that he is probably the most lucid person in the show. Because he reads so many books, he looks further than his friends. He read the French poet rambo. Rimbaud is a religious icon whose poetry is full of arcanism and who has no contempt for hypocrisy. Rimbaud also participated in the Paris society and wrote an ode to the uprising on March 18, 871. Fried inherited the poet’s vulnerability, and he understood the fascist plot, but could not dissuade anyone around him.<br>He hated war, but perhaps he hated his own weakness even more.<br>So he was reluctant to shoot in the early days of the Soviet invasion.<br>But Fried is very adaptable. His brother will have doubts, will give up because of compassion, and he won’t. He abandons compassion, and in order to survive, he chooses to become a machine that can only carry out the orders of his superiors.<br>This confirms what he said before the war, that war brings out the bad in people.<br>He thought a Nazi lieutenant colonel had killed a jewish girl and was crying.<br>He has fallen.<br>Maybe at some point he wanted to return to the light. But germans, and even his parents, seem to regard his return from injury as a humiliation. Under pressure, he returned to the battlefield.<br>In 1945, scattered German soldiers on the eastern front began to return from various fronts, and friedham and several national stormtroopers met the soviets on their way home.<br>A few hot-blooded young men wanted to die for their country.<br>“You are children,” said friedham finally. “the russians will send you home.”<br>Then he ran into a Russian bullet and used his body to tell the young men behind him that the war was over.<br>A good soldier is weak most of the time, but strong occasionally.<br>At last he was truly brave, and then he collapsed on the eve of peace.<br>The reason why he left the birth to his children was that his character had not changed from beginning to end. Laughably, the elder brother has always been the mature brother, and the younger brother has always been the weak and kind brother.<br>Will fled because he had a sense of responsibility. He knew that it was wrong to attack the Soviet union, but his soldiers would be condemned if he stopped. His brother became the executioner not because he was sensible, but because he was afraid, he did not want to die, can only to adapt to the harsh environment, then he lived a muddle, death in his release.<br>Maybe it is a kind of atonement, when he did not save the little girl of the Soviet union, finally found the result here.<br>Then there was Sally, the war nurse. She was the youngest, eager to serve her country, and she had the childlike innocence of a child who silently loved will.<br>Sometimes, however, the child’s unconscious actions are even more brutal.<br>At first she was hopeful, compassionate, and distressed by the soldiers’ injuries. But her “flower of evil” also blossomed during the war, and she became a qualified field nurse, turning on jewish women and even betraying Soviet girls who had helped her.<br>Her fear and doubt in the face of the war is very small, I see from her is not vicious, but a weak girl with layers of cocoon to protect themselves. Pathetic and pathetic. She represents the vast majority of ordinary people, muddled with the leader’s pace, not to think why, also dare not resist.<br>Fortunately, the human nature of the good, finally returned to the good, in order to sonny gave up the retreat, finally survived.<br>And Greta.<br>Greta is a contradictory individual. She is so beautiful that her friends think she will be a star. But the cruel war could not bear an innocent and useless woman. She traded the only thing she had, beauty, for the chance for her jewish boyfriend to escape, for an empty life.<br>Her love affair with a young Jew, victor, was Platonic, not carnal. She really loved him, across race and across national faith. She lives both fully and confusedly.<br>On April 11, 1945, she was executed for defeatism.<br>Did not see the dawn, no lover drunk smoked kiss.<br>She died with a pale skin. At least in the end she is clean, like a ray of moonlight, according to the broken heart.<br>I can’t tell if she’s wrong. Chastity and flesh are sometimes worthless in the face of life. In giving her a chance, she may yet seduce for the sake of her future with her lover<br>On May 8, 1945, Germany surrendered.<br>In the devastated streets, victor, a Jew, was free to walk, and he would no longer be humiliated by racial discrimination.<br>The family lost their sewing shop at kristallnacht and life took a nosedib. He lost almost everything in the war, which shows the impotence of small groups in the face of large forces. He suffered most from a broken heart. Victor knew that he and the germans are not different, but he had to rely on his girlfriend’s body for escape, he wandered all the way, save also be saved. He was the one who truly saw the warmth of the world.<br>He returned to the prewar bar and lifted the lid. He didn’t play the piano because the beautiful girl who danced was dead. He lost the love of his life.<br>Without rock music and baked cakes, without tearful hugs and kisses, the three men who were alive approached each other with distancing precaution.<br>They toasted their dead old friends and brothers.<br>The wounds of the war are hard to heal, and every young face in the camera has read all the sorrows of the world, becoming vicissitudes and confusion. World war ii is over, and then what? Where do they go from here?<br>I don’t know if they will meet again. They might get together and talk about their wishful thinking, but maybe they won’t, because it will only remind them of those four bloody years.<br>After I read it, I felt very painful. Sometimes my personal fate paled before the war. It’s not anybody who’s wrong. It’s the war. It’s everybody.<br>May there be no war in the world, and may all people make the right decisions when the chips are down.</p>

        <p>Learning experience of data analysis</p>
<p>I had very little knowledge of python and would only issue a few simple instructions. After the later learning, I was surprised to find that python has powerful third-party programs that can help with different types of data. The power of python can be clearly seen from the mind map I drew below.</p>

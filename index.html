        <p>Because I was curious about this mysterious case that had something to do with the economic dilemma, I found a law student’s analysis of this fictitious case on the Internet.</p>
<p>The following is what I reprinted：</p>
<p>案件回溯：“五名洞穴探险人受困山洞，水尽粮绝，无法在短期内获救。为了维持生存以待救援，大家约定抽签吃掉其中一人，牺牲他以救活其余四人。威特莫尔是这一方案的最初建议人，但在抽签之前突然返回决定收回建议。但其他四人执意抽签，又恰好抽中了威特莫尔，于是他被牺牲掉以救活其他四人。获救后这四人以谋杀罪被初审法院判处死刑。”<br>在写这份判决意见书之前，我反复阅读了案件，也认真分析了前面十四位大法官的判决意见书，同样的事实，适应同样的法律，得出的判决却天壤之别。在我看来，个别论证无懈可击，精致缜密；但也存在个别论证羊质虎皮，不经推敲。我支持有罪，我承认在阅读前面十四位大法官的判决书之中，也曾纠结混沌，但最后时刻却是柳暗花明，我的观点反而更加坚定。以下是我的判决意见书。<br>1、绝对平等的人权，生命不可量化<br>  每个人的生命都是绝对平等的，威特莫尔一个人的生命与其他同伴数人的生命具有同样的价值，生命本身是绝对的，而不是相对的。塔利法官的“‘一命换多命’是一项划算的交易”的观点在我看来纯属谬论。他说：我们如此珍视生命，以至于我们总倾向于更多的而不是更少的人在悲剧中存活下来。是的，我们如此珍视生命，但这并不意味着少数人就有义务（排除自愿奉献生命的个体）牺牲自己的生命换回他人的生命。也许你会觉的牺牲一人换回五人的生命是多么值得的交换。从数字上，也许你会倍感欣慰。可你有没有想过，生命是具体的，不是单纯数字简单的对比。当你成为那不幸的一人时，你才会知道用数字去简单衡量生命的价值是多么可笑。你自己是一个具有完全生命特征的人，他也是，对于其他人都是如此，让他牺牲为你们保全生命，这对于他公平吗？威特莫尔在掷骰子之前，已经表示撤回约定。而其他人指责他出尔反尔，替他掷骰子，我们可以想象威特莫尔被强行杀害，五马分尸的场面，这一切都是建立在不平等的基础上的。任何人都没有权利去强行剥夺他人的生命，被害人不平等的承担死亡是不公平的。在此基础上，任何所谓的辩解都是诡辩，都是个人价值观对于案件细枝末节的同情。<br>2、法律与正义<br>  立法者追求正义之法，司法实践者追求正义司法。法律成为了正义的化身，换言之，正义乃是法律的永久追求。但同时我们必须意识到正义是一种价值判断，而价值判断与人的观念联系在一起。俗话说：一千个读者就有一千个哈姆雷特。而一千个法官则有一千个正义观。<br>那什么样的正义观是法律追求的正义观呢？这不得而知。<br>  福斯特法官认为：法律精神高于法令文字，一个人可以违反法律的场面规定而不违反法律本身。换言之，福斯特法官试图脱离法律文字，以自身正义观判决他们无罪，但无罪符合法律的正义观吗？在我看来，福斯特法官的正义观无非是对被告人的同情。第一：如果每件有争议的案件都以个人意志决定，那法律尊严何在。第二：福斯特一类法官的辩论把焦点完全放在了被告人身上，如果他们把视角同样转向被害人，他们的正义观就会倒塌。也许你会说一个死去的人不具有值得考虑的生命权，那不如把威特莫尔夸大为“威特莫尔类人”。他们是一种存在的潜在人群，因为探险活动数不胜数，随时有可能发生同样的悲剧。书中有句话说：“法官在适用规则的过程中则必须超脱于自身的“道德偏好”和“政治立场”，为了正义，法官必须成为“道德偏好”和“政治立场”的合法反对者。”我认为法官追求正义的前提是必须尊重法律的尊严与司法的权威。坦言之，我们也许无法直接体验到“绝对正义”，但必须坚信存在走向“绝对正义”的可能性。<br>  我支持有罪。</p>
<p>读后感：台湾中研院副院长曾志朝曾在推荐文中写道：“这本书对大多数大学生或一般人而言，好好地读，确实可以提高思辨的能力，而且对于法律在生存与道德之间的定位，因社会、文化里人情因素的介入就会生变的过程也会有所警觉。”这本书需要句斟字酌，确实是本好书。<br>  我的观点客观上来说并不新颖，特朗派特法官与个别法官也有论述，换汤不换药，唯一优点可能就是更为详尽，但也不否定存在漏洞，毕竟作为大一学生，知识有限。作为一个法学生，我只是在尝试去描述一个观点，去模仿一份判决意见书，使自己的观点更有说服力。也许数年后的自己对此案件会有更多感悟。<br>    法律思维是在不断推翻不断肯定中培养出来的。富勒和萨伯撰写这十四份判决观点除了展示了法律具有多样性外，还强调了法官自身的内在性思维。这是初出茅庐的法学本科生所严重缺乏的，要想锻炼这种能力，我们还需要大量阅读类似于《洞穴奇案》的法制类书籍以及电影，以形成自己独特的思维模式，客观全面地看待问题。既能从别人能想到的角度分析问题,也能从别人想不到的角度分析问题。</p>

        <p>Yale Open Course: Philosophy - Death</p>
<p><strong>Having recently become interested in philosophy again (yes, for the second time), I went online to find the Open Course on Philosophy at Yale university and attended the first two lectures. These are a little difficult for me to understand, so I’ve summarized the previous part that I can understand and made a summary.</strong></p>
<p>The popular view is that death damages our bodies, but since our souls are immaterial, they can survive death. Hope for a soul. Death sucks. Possibility of immortality. Because life is so precious, it is so shameful to waste it that people should not attempt suicide.<br>But it turns out that’s wrong, there’s no soul, and immortality is not a good thing. Fear of death is a normal response. Suicide can also be justified and morally justified.<br>The ultimate goal: to make students think independently and look at death objectively<br>PS: Try not to take religious views into account</p>
<ol>
<li>The nature of people<br>(1) What is a person made of? What am I?<br>The second theory holds that a person is composed of a body and a soul. The body and soul interact with each other. Once the body dies, the soul will lose contact but still exist<br>According to physicalism, a person is just made up of bodies, and a person is a material entity<br>Idealism holds that man has only his soul, and the real world is imagined by the soul.<br>Can I survive my death?<br>Rebuttal: The question itself is false and confuses concepts</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Jay Rosenberg</strong>: When a person dies, that’s the end of life, so the question becomes, “Can a person continue to live after the end of life?” “The answer, of course, is” no “. There can be no new life after death.</p>
<p>Death, blood stops flowing, the brain is deprived of oxygen, the cells can’t repair the wound, the vital cells fail, the body dies.</p>
<p>1, What is the idea,or What is the concept of surviving?</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy is really interesting, because I found out that the professor is really doing a deep analysis of a few common problems, which seems boring and keeps repeating a point, but is actually a way of thinking. It’s a pity that I couldn’t finish the course because of language problems, but I hope I can have access to similar courses in the future.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>The commercialization of intangible cultural heritage</strong></p>
<p>—I spent six days working with my team members to build a platform to help commercialize intangible cultural heritage.</p>
<p>The poster I drew:</p>
<p><img src="C:%5CUsers%5Cjosie%5CAppData%5CRoaming%5CTypora%5Ctypora-user-images%5Cimage-20200801220231748.png" alt="image-20200801220231748"></p>

<p>The English name of our company is <strong>Leran</strong>, which means happy in Chinese.</p>
<p><strong>The market of intangible cultural heritage</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The blank spots<br>Nowadays, there is a lack of intangible cultural heritage education in the market, and the young generation in China lacks practical experience in this field.<br>The seriousness is that fewer and fewer people are willing to learn intangible cultural heritage, and the inheritance of technology is facing great problems.<br>Lack of traditional culture and the combination of modern technology, the older generation of artisans stuck in a rut, lack of innovation.</li>
</ol>
<p>   2 . solutions:<br>   Sale of intangible cultural heritage related courses and online classes are available</p>
<p>   Online courses mainly teach theories, the historical development of intangible cultural heritage, cultural deposits and production skills, etc.</p>
<p>   Offline classes focus on practice, allowing students to personally experience the production process. To realize the combination of handicrafts and modern technology of intangible cultural heritage.</p>
<p>   Start classes by age group.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>For users:<br>(1)   Pupils and their parents<br>(2）Children aged 6 to 16 years<br>(3)   Cultivate the love of traditional culture and the inheritor from childhood</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Market size:<br>70% of stores and personnel are abroad, North America: one on the East or West coast of the United States, one on the West coast of Canada. Europe: Concentrated in London’s Chinatown<br>China’s economy is developing rapidly and cultural exchanges have become increasingly frequent since the reform and opening up<br>The number of overseas students is increasing gradually. Taking advantage of this market opportunity, we aspire to be the leading exporter of Chinese culture<br>Policy: In line with the spirit and concept of inheriting traditional culture, carry out systematic cultural education. Carry forward The Chinese culture abroad, gather overseas students and Overseas Chinese. The government strongly supports the export of culture.</li>
</ol>
<p>   ​      5. Core competitiveness</p>
<p>   ​          Innovation, passion, authenticity<br>   ​          Grab the overseas market<br>   ​          The good faith company<br>   ​          Product: Chinese soul, world mind<br>   ​          The moat of competitive core force: turn of fortune, lead a team</p>
<p>Company philosophy:<br>Many modern cultural and creative product designs ignore the interpretation of traditional culture. Inheritance can not be simply understood as the inheritance of carriers, but more importantly, the continuation of intangible cultural heritage. So while embodies innovative spirit, Cu sichuan culture co., LTD., also pay attention to keep the core of the intangible process, and attention to overseas Chinatown.</p>
<p>In the offline experience store, we will sell some modern products and handmade gift boxes made by intangible cultural heritage techniques. The gift box includes a simple tutorial of intangible cultural heritage products and raw materials for the products, allowing buyers to make ancient art in the far East with their own hands. For example, in the paper-cut gift box, we will provide a detailed paper-cut course and cultural science for people to learn, as well as the materials for making paper-cut.</p>

        <p>调查问卷</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How to defend yourself from anyone who pops up on the road, or what to do if someone is following you down the road.</strong><br>Four people: go to the place that the person is much walk, even if want detour to run away also don’t walk small alley, can make a phone call to report a location to the family next what.<br>Two: About the boycott, if he finds someone clutching his cell phone or a key ring in his bag after him, he may even fight back when he comes up and yell.<br>One: Tell him I have an infectious disease…</li>
<li><strong>What happens after a sexual assault? (Female: five)</strong><br>One person (high school) : there is one, if the conditions allow, I want to kill him. I have glasses, metal pendants on my clothes, or a phone that falls off the floor and I try to hit him on the head, or I can pick my finger out of his eye. If somebody fucking fucks me I’m gonna do my best to kill him, or if he runs away or doesn’t get sentenced then I’m gonna have to live with this humiliation forever?<br>Two people (high school) : don’t know, at that time should what idea all have no, guarantee he don’t hurt me to go, live or more important, later strike revenge is not late.<br>One person (High school) : No, but it must be very painful, I think I might choose to commit suicide or something, such a thing is terrible, it will make me doubt the bright side of the world.<br>One person (high school) : I know you want to hear evidence, catch him two times leave scar what. But I don’t think the brain can handle the panic. I might want to pass out.</li>
<li><strong>If your brother（good friend） turns out to be an abuser, what do you do? (Male: 7)</strong><br>One (college student) : Beat him up and ask him what happened. I learned that he should have told me this matter on his own initiative, so he should be a very important or close friend to me. He told me that it must be because of guilt and insecurity. I think I will decide according to the situation, and it is better to deal with it privately, because both men and women do not want this matter to become a big deal.<br>One person (college student) : he make this kind of thing already is not my brother, report to the police directly, I should have no such disgusting person around.<br>One person (Junior High school student) :?? Why do you ask such a question? I just junior high school ok, so disgusting? Call the police, call the police, this is too crazy. But we can’t judge anything at our age.<br>Three people (high school student) : advise him to surrender, the minor still has the opportunity to repent, also won’t sentence particularly heavy. But if he doesn’t turn himself in, There’s nothing I can do about it. After all, I don’t know how to deal with it.<br>One person (high school) : think fear extreme, in the side, terrible, but if the police what he didn’t know is I did it, in case he psychopathic, that I also very dangerous. How about an anonymous letter?</li>
<li><strong>Coping measures in the face of acquaintance crime</strong><br>Two people: I think I can basically not consider this point, my social circle is the same sex relatively familiar friends, generally gather in the coffee shop ah such places, teachers do not have the possibility of home visits, and then my parents’ colleagues I am not very familiar with, hardly met.<br>One person: Although I have a wide social circle, I also have close and ordinary friends. Intimate friends, I think, are all sincere to me. I won’t be lonely when we go out together.<br>One: Ah, to get his sympathy? After all, we’ve known each other for so long. If there’s nothing to hide, it can’t be said. Dude, he’s gonna get me first.</li>
<li><strong>What do you think if sexual assault happens to someone you know (look at things, look at people)</strong><br>Four people: won’t discriminate, be very sympathize with, feel her very pitiful, everywhere let her point.<br>One person: I will try my best as this thing did not happen, I will not go to tell her the abuser how how disgusting, because that is very hypocritical, I also don’t want to bring up her bad memories, hope she can come out as soon as possible.<br>Two people: Definitely not colored glasses, but she’s probably the first person I think of when I think of a rape case or a story about it…<br>One person: first of all to the matter that affirmation is indignant, if have me to be able to help of I affirmation would like. And then for people, I am not a man to go out of my way to comfort the girl, at most she is very sad, and my roommate to tell her if we meet that scum will definitely kill him. But if it happened to my girlfriend, I don’t know, maybe there would still be a little bit of prejudice, I don’t know if it would work, even though I don’t have a girlfriend.<br>What do you think of the “perfect victim”?<br>What is a “perfect victim”? That is to say, all the discussion is about focusing a magnifying glass on the victim, not the suspect, not the potentially responsible party. Then it becomes something else entirely: if your victim wants to make any kind of claim, then you have to prove, under all kinds of questioning, that there is nothing wrong with you, not in expression, not in fact, not in economics, not in morality, not in character. Otherwise, others can stand on the “rational, neutral, objective” perspective to analyze, prove that the victim is actually ulterior motives, black and white, self-inflicted…… As a result, people forget what the victim initially advocated and are busy discussing who the victim is. Source url: <a href="https://www.sohu.com/a/155474972_163208" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.sohu.com/a/155474972_163208</a>)<br>Three people: very laughable, should aim spearhead at suspect first, make what use does the victim have?<br>One person: The loophole of this respect law is quite big, if need “perfect victim”, that must ask the victim body to remain seminal fluid ah scratch, isn’t this a disease? She has been hurt, you also do not allow her the first time to clear out the pain, but to prove their purity. It’s really hopeless.<br>Twos: But you do need enough evidence to show that rape is true, in case of a fight or some other personal reason. But there are doubts.</li>
</ol>
<p>   The solution：</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal: Eating out alone, not eating food out of sight; Drink sensibly;</li>
<li>Society: Newspapers, media and TV series boycott “perfect victims”; Make similar games</li>
<li>From the perspective of family education: parents of boys warn boys to respect and care for women and cultivate their three views of boys from childhood; Pay attention to children’s mental health; Reduce strife within the family; Don’t overlook the way couples get along</li>
<li>Popularizing legal perspective: Cultivate children’s legal awareness from an early age, so that they are aware of the serious consequences of breaking the law and the harm they will cause to others. Watching documentaries, designing courses. Increase public service advertisements of legal type.</li>
<li>Angle of legal punishment: intensify punishment and judge according to the situation; Chemical castration; Sexual assaults are tracked for life and personal information is disclosed for a decade</li>
</ul>

        <p>India’s Daughter<br>On December 16, 2012, Jyoti Singh Pandey, an Indian medical intern, mistakenly boarded a bus that was not on duty at 8.30pm and was later beaten and gang-raped by six male passengers with iron bars. She suffered severe wounds to her abdomen, intestines and genitals after being attacked with iron bars. On December 29, Jodie died due to unsuccessful rescue efforts, and it took 13 days for her to die.<br>India’s Daughter, a BBC documentary on the subject, was to be released on March 8, 2015, international Women’s Day. In an unexpected twist, Indian authorities recently controversially banned the film from the country, citing its sensitive content as potentially disruptive.<br>After watching it, I cried miserably. Sometimes I find that we are powerless in front of many things. No matter how powerful the power of ordinary people is, even if it is a parade, there is no way to bring the victims back true justice, not to mention an apology.<br>A dying girl who had been gang-raped and beaten lay naked in the wilderness, surrounded by more than 30 men, with no one to help her. No one came forward when the police came with sheets and water and asked for help.<br>Jodie was fortunate to have been born in a family where there was no son preference and she was about to graduate to become a doctor.<br>Who ruined it all?<br>It was the rapist who beat her, the innocent bystanders, the rapist’s defense lawyer, the Indian authorities who banned the documentary, all the dirty, sexually-minded people in the world.<br>“It takes two to tango,” rapist Mukesh Singh said. A decent girl doesn’t hang out at 9 o ‘clock at night. Girls are responsible for rape.” He even said that when a girl is raped, there should be no resistance. She should have been raped quietly. Then when they were done they would throw her out of the car and give the boy only a beating. Defense lawyers say only flowers placed in temples can be respected.<br>The scariest part of the story is that she didn’t get on the bus alone, and her boyfriend was also badly beaten.</p>

        <p>城市二十四小时</p>
<p>【郑州】【武汉】【深圳】</p>
<p>这是三座生活节奏非常快的城市。</p>
<p>郑州是个中转站，它是中国的十字路口，有中国最大编组站，中国最繁忙的车站以及全球最大医院。</p>
<p>在凌晨四点左右，火车站便人满为患，来自各地的人们由这里出发，涌向其他所有的省份，显而易见，在这里，你可以看见整个中国。而截止至次日凌晨两点，全球最大的医院郑州大学附属第一医院才刚刚落下今日的帷幕。</p>
<p>站长与医生，都是平凡而忙碌的职业，在熙熙攘攘的人群中帮助他人，是他们的职责以及毕生坚持的信仰。</p>
<p>每个城市都有新旧交替或共同存在的现象。</p>
<p>郑州有最大的iPhone生产线，也有古老的国棉四厂。年轻人走向四海八荒的人才市场谋一份前程，老人们则悠然自得的待在过去的时光里，守着一份属于自己的安逸。</p>
<p>（但我没有搞懂为什么要花那么长时间去讲豫剧，豫剧确实是当地的文化特色，但强调有很多小孩子去学我就不太明白了）</p>
<p>而市井气和快速发展也同样是武汉灵魂的一部分，提到武汉，人们首先想到的是热干面和光谷。在老街吃完早饭后，一批又一批的年轻人进入市场，为资本而奋斗。无数人站在失败者的肩上往上爬。</p>
<p>深圳就更不用提了，最年轻的城市，发展速度极快，所有人都遵循超过996的作息时间，数十乃至上百亿的资金在公司之间流动。每一次会谈都是在成功与被淘汰之间博弈。</p>
<p>尽管前路坎坷，仍有无数新深圳人来到这个逐梦之地，让深圳不得不建了世界上数量最多的摩天大楼以及填了相当于两个澳门那么大的海域。</p>
<p>【成都】【厦门】</p>
<p>这两座城市相比较而言会慢节奏一点。</p>
<p>成都是著名的小吃圣地，连街边都有便宜而便民的露天茶馆。外地人来成都里，去宽窄巷子感受他们心中的成都，而成都人更愿意去周边的农家乐，做一个田园诗人，乐得清闲。但他们共同的割舍不掉的就是火锅。他们平均每人可以等待的极限时间是3.5个小时，真是可歌可泣。</p>
<p>对比成都浓重的城市味儿，厦门的人们最常去的则是秀美的鼓浪屿。鼓浪屿与世隔绝，虽然与厦门岛仅仅相隔600米，岛上却缺失很多必需品，得靠推板车的年轻人拉回来。</p>
<p>午后，岛上的音乐家</p>
<p>这两座城市都兴盛书店和酒吧，文艺青年不爱回家，于是就去书吧里畅读一夜，或是去酒吧来首民谣。这也就是为什么这儿的年轻人平均睡觉时间比上面三座繁忙的城市更晚的原因吧。</p>
<p>这部纪录片没有把焦点放在城市本生上，反倒是多了不少生活的烟火气，描写了非常多的城中村，把人生的本质体现的淋漓尽致。</p>

        <p>“Things I have Been Silent About: Memories” is a purely autobiographical account of the author’s family and friends, and of the tumultuous times she lived through in Iran. In this book, silent matters encompass victims, families and countries. Dictators want more power by keeping the masses quiet, rewriting history and stealing the day; Witnesses remain silent, do not want to see the world ugly to say, to maintain the surface of the hypocrisy of nothing happened; The silence of the victim leads them to feel guilty, making them an accomplice to the person who hurt them.</p>
<p>There is so much silence, so much that it covers the whole of Iran and fills every nook and cranny of Nafisi’s childhood.</p>
<p>Nafisi’s assault made her feel painful and fearful for a long time. When she grew up and wanted to overcome her fear, she found that she had to break the silence. Silence, not choosing to speak out about the experience of being violated, is actually a compromise to the crime.</p>
<p>But what could she have done as a child? The perpetrator was a respectable man, and Nafisi felt his parents would not believe him.</p>
<p>In order to meet her mother’s expectations, she began a failed marriage, in the eyes of others for her happiness is shackled. She had the pleasure of going abroad to learn new ideas, to learn about independence from revolution, and she began to yearn for the independence of her country, but she could not change her life.</p>
<p><strong>Epilogue</strong>: After the Islamic Revolution, I realized how fragile our existence in this world is, your comforting home, your sense of self, your sense of identity, belonging, everything can be taken away from you at any time. From the stories my father taught me, I learned to create a home in my own world, a home that has nothing to do with geography, nationality, or anything else that can be taken away from me, that no one can take away from me. But these stories do not lessen the pain of losing my parents; Nor do they provide comfort and live to an end. It wasn’t until after they died that I realized that each, in their own way, had given me a mobile home. This home protects my memories and continues to help me resist the brutality inflicted upon us by man and time.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt</strong>: In the memoir, my father describes a form of paedophilia that was prevalent in Iranian society. The paedophilia is mainly caused by “the prohibition of contact between men and women. “Adolescent males have no access to any women except their mothers, sisters, aunts,” he argues. “Most mental disorders are rooted in sexual deprivation.” He goes on to explain that this bias is not confined to the Catholic community.</p>
<p>I can’t be as generous as my father. Intellectually I can understand the complexity - I know that marrying a nine-year-old girl is normal at some point, not taboo. Within certain boundaries, hypocrisy is not a vice, but a way to survive. But that did not comfort me, nor did it remove my sense of shame. I am glad that social, ethnic and legal traditions can be changed, so we will no longer burn women as witches, no longer have slaves, no longer stone people to death; You know, our mothers can care more about their children, they can protect them from paedophiles. My generation was in the dawn of that transition. His way of life had become taboo, just as marriage between first Cousins, once normal in ancient society, had been forbidden by law.</p>
<p>It was at Haji Agha’s that I received my first and most painful injury. Other similar injuries are more likely to be unintentional and easier to forget. But they invariably made me feel ashamed, angry and hopeless. I couldn’t tell my parents because they were adults just like pedophiles. His mother obeyed and respected him so much. Will they trust me, or Will they trust Haji Agha? As I got older, I learned to put the experience in a larger context, to distance myself from it. I look at it as a social illness, not as a personal experience. This had a somewhat therapeutic effect: I felt a little more powerful in the face of unchangeable social reality. I also began to understand that what I was going through was happening all over the world, not just to me; Knowing that there is a little boy or girl in New York or Baghdad who has the same secret as me. It was both comforting and disturbing but it didn’t completely cure the pain and confusion of the experience and I kept quiet about it for a long time. I have never written about Haji Agha in my diary, although I have recalled the experience again and again in my mind, so that all the details are still fresh in my mind. (p62)</p>
<p>Sometimes people think that it’s not appropriate to put paedophiles or children being sexually abused in the context of sexual abuse, because children may not even know what’s going on. But I think it’s necessary because children can understand the damage that an abuser can do, and know that sometimes their own truth is hard to believe. If it’s a teacher, if it’s a white collar, if it’s a good-looking elite, the kids can’t help it, because they don’t know that anyone will trust them.</p>

        <p><strong>This film is included in my thematic study. But because girls who are sexually abused in the film are used as leads, it was not included in the study.</strong><br><strong>I want to recommend this film to more people, to make people understand justice and love.</strong></p>
<p>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing</p>
<p>After watching the film, I found that the girl received sexual assault is only a trigger, which is the theme throughout the film, the beginning and end of the mother’s revenge.</p>
<p>The story takes place in a remote town, where Mill’s daughter is raped and murdered, but the local police do nothing, so the angry mother rents three billboards in the town to reveal the useless sheriff, hoping to let sheriff Willoughby continue to investigate the criminal.</p>
<p>Mother Mill is an independent female hero, because her daughter’s death is indirectly caused by her, so she vowed to find the murderer. She is eloquent, has a strong thinking ability, and has a very strong personality, but it is precisely because of such excessive sensibility that she will do extremely irrational things.</p>
<p>Constable Dixon has a strong propensity for violence and the same emotional disregard for things that should be used mentally. He seems to be the archetypal bad guy, mambo, racist, and closet.</p>
<p>Sheriff Willoughby is the most rational person in the play. He has the emotional part, but he has a heavy view of the big picture and will consider the possible result first. Although he is foul-mouthed, he has been working for the townsfolk. His terminal cancer makes him feel inadequate to deal with mill’s daughter’s case.</p>
<p>The play USES several threes, three billboards put up by Mill, three letters left by Willoughby after his suicide, three members of the leading group, and three outbreaks of conflict. Together, they explain good and evil, and justice in the eyes of ordinary people. The rape case is an imprint that brings out the pursuit of so-called justice among people of different classes.</p>
<p>At first, Mill thinks that both the murderer and the police are evil. They represent the evil men who rape and kill women and the bourgeoisie who look on coldly. Then the priest and dentist who spoke for the sheriff became accomplices – because they and the police belonged to a “group,” a group of bystanders with no help or empathy. However, as the story progresses, her attitude towards the police changes, and she feels guilty for her aggressiveness and insubordination. At this time, the image of the police in her heart changes to some extent.</p>
<p>The evil in Dixon’s eyes is first the reactionary Mill, and then the advertiser who helps Mill for money. His good idea comes from his boss Dixon, when Dixon dies of suicide, his anger and despair make him beat the advertiser, and then he is fired by the new sheriff.</p>
<p>The second conflict of the story is the death of Willoughby, the cancer is about to destroy him completely, so he shot his own life, from the cloth covering his head to ask his family not to open it and put flowers beside the left letter can be seen that he is a very sensitive man. He left three letters to his wife, Mill and Dixon, and it was these letters that changed the character’s conception of good and evil.</p>
<p>The letter to Mill explains that in a very emotional move, he helped her pay for the next month’s advertisement and encouraged her not to give up on finding the murderer, saying that he was sorry he had not found the prisoner.<br>Then billboards are burned, what glimmers of hope are extinguished, and Mill, in his agony, torches the police station.</p>
<p>The third conflict was in the burning police station, where Dixon was reading Willoughby’s letter. He understood the sheriff’s painstaking efforts at this time, in the fire to save mill’s daughter’s scroll. Obviously, he knows that Mill started the fire, but instead of using violence to solve the problem, he wants to do something for Mill’s daughter with a last bit of kindness.</p>
<p>The last little man, a retired soldier with a cheeky smile, was the only one in the whole play who was as bad as his bones. He bragged in the bar about raping and killing girls, and even came to mock Mill after seeing the billboard, wishing he were the devil who raped and killed her daughter. Although Dixon’s hard-won cortical tissue shows that the soldier was in Iraq at the time of the crime, his actions cannot be forgiven, so at the end, Mill and Dixon, two enemies, finally put aside their prejudices and decide to go together to find the soldier.<br>It’s an open ending. They may or may not be outlaws who kill soldiers.</p>
<p> No matter what, justice is always there.</p>

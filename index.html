        <p>Strange consumer psychology</p>
<ol>
<li>The higher the price, the better to sell – Vanity effect (Egret Effect)</li>
</ol>
<p>In 1950 Harvey Leibenstein, an American economist, published the vanity effect and its corresponding conformity effect.</p>
<p>Rich people generally do not like the public to imitate their consumption behavior, because they want to be different when they buy goods. To put it simply, the vanity effect is the tendency to pursue high-grade goods.</p>
<p>Specific manifestations of vanity effect:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy high-end products quickly when they first come on the market.</li>
<li>Stop buying once its market share reaches a level that the general public can consume.</li>
</ol>
<p>The higher the goods are, the more they are consumed by individuals, the more obvious the vanity effect is. If it is not mainly for personal consumption, and the goods are purchased for external display, even if the price is high, the higher the price, the more the demand will increase the herd effect.</p>
<p>If it is believed that vanity effect is more likely to occur in the target market, marketing policies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pay more attention to the lifetime value of a product than its market share. That is to say, in the choice of market strategy, focus on maintaining the original customers, because if only focus on the immediate interests and focus on market expansion and ignore the original customers, one day even the original customers will leave. Moreover, at some point, the marketing strategy must not only stop expanding new users, it must also do demarketing to prevent the influx of new users.</li>
<li>Absolutely avoid price competition. Cutting prices creates two problems. The general public, which is sensitive to price, will buy the product after the price has been lowered<br>(1) Reduce the scarcity of commodities, leading to the departure of existing customers<br>(2) The deterioration of commodity quality.</li>
<li>As a late entrant, try to avoid business promotions such as “me too”. Because markets with a vanity effect seem to have good yields and few competitors.<br>When a new competitor enters the market, the market itself may collapse. The participation of new competitors will increase consumption, but the original customers may choose to leave the market because of the vanity effect. The original business had already enjoyed high profits, so it could recoup its investment costs, while the new competitors could only suffer huge losses.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Big Spending Saves the Economy – Paradox of Thrift<br>If you consume more than your income, you have no way to save, and you end up living in poverty. So we work hard to be rich, and sometimes we become stingy, trying to save more money.<br>This is true for individuals, but bad for the economy as a whole.<br>Can the country really become richer if all its citizens become stingy? The answer is no, especially in a bad economy. Let’s see why.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the economy goes into recession, people will save more and consume less because they are worried about the future. But if everyone consumes less, business sales will fall and inventories will increase. As a result, companies can only reduce production and employment, and their employees’ income will decrease. Worries about the future will intensify, people will become more determined to spend less and save more, and the economy as a whole will be trapped in a downward spiral.<br>This leads to the paradox that saving is reasonable from an individual’s point of view, but not economically as a whole. This is called the Paradox of Thrift. If businesses cannot increase their consumption, the government should also step in to increase government spending by offering preferential terms for enterprises to invest and make efforts to attract foreign investors and tourists to increase investment and consumption. Only in this way can a virtuous circle be formed and the economy eventually get better.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Free is not always good – Free Economics<br>“There is no such thing as a free lunch” was Milton Friedman, the famous economist who won the Nobel Prize for economics in 1976<br>Some information may seem free at first glance, but in fact it doesn’t mean free at all. Or it can be interpreted as some kind of lure behind free, or it can be interpreted as not expecting something free at no cost.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gradually, however, the case for true free is gaining ground. Just as bad money drives out good, the trend towards free eviction fees is reinforced. The Economist, a British newspaper, looked ahead to 2008 and named the trend “freeconomics”, combining the words “free” and “economics” to form a new word.</p>
<p>Look around us and you’ll find a lot of free marketing, including the free newspaper in front of the subway station. Free newspapers, which once threatened dailies and sports newspapers, have large readership and are highly profitable from advertising. Less popular freeshees would be pushed out of business because they could not generate enough advertising revenue, so that the surviving freeshees could gradually occupy more favorable positions. The richer the company, the more likely it is to survive the free competition. Therefore, consumers may also face losses caused by monopoly.<br>However, another drawback of free markets is the waste of resources. Free newspapers, for example, waste a lot of newsprint because they are given away free to consumers. A system of mass production and mass consumption can lead to an overuse of energy and lead to an acceleration of global warming.</p>

        <p>I think freedom is a profound word. A lot of people do. Their childhood is the most free, but the truth is that people have never been free, they need to do a lot of things, need to follow the rules at all times, according to the established procedures. Similarly, students and employees have become the victims of surveillance and failed education under the evolving air system.<br>In fact, the purpose of using AI to monitor students’ learning is good. Parents and teachers hope to make students more obedient in this way, improve students’ learning efficiency, and enable students to get better grades so as to obtain a better future. It’s true, but it never occurred to them that it destroyed the students’ ability to have fun, deprived them of the joy they should have had at this age, and forced them to put on a false mask and live like robots. Sure, they may do well in the future, they will become excellent people, but they have lost their creativity forever, lost the joyful power to laugh freely, and they are all prisoners. Sink in the cage of the classroom.<br>For them, youth is a distant word of beauty.</p>
<p>However, to some extent, the AI monitoring system not only fails to help them, but also distorts their psychology. They can feel the intense pressure all the time, and they have to learn. They go to school not just for the sake of their own interests, but for the sake of a future job, a job they don’t even know what it is. This kind of learning, though efficient, is undoubtedly useless. They may go to jobs they hate and do things they don’t like in the future, but they have no choice, or they have no choice at all.<br>It’s not just a school problem, it’s a society problem. It’s like amazon spying on employees. It seems that what society wants is only machines that can work for it and contribute all their strength to its process, rather than living human beings. Human beings are called human beings because we have a variety of emotions, we feel sad and angry, we do whatever we want to do, we think and think.<br>And what is a machine? It’s emotionless, it’s fake, it’s not real. He will act according to the procedures given to him, not out of his own will. There is a big difference between the two. If the AI system is to continue to develop and enter every household, the situation will be deteriorated. Who knows if what you do will end up in some file? If it goes on like this, there will be no further development of human beings, because all their sense of innovation has been completely wiped out.</p>

        <p>Super carrier Reagan </p>
<p>Great engineering campaign, the title is the highest praise for the aircraft carrier! America’s technological prowess is truly admirable. Super carrier Ronald Reagan is the most advanced nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and single weapon in the world. It is also the first aircraft carrier commissioned by the United States in the 21st century. It operates in international waters and in American territory, with aircraft, weapons and a fine navy of 5, 000, ready to be there when it is needed (often for long-distance transport).The Reagan is the uss nimitz-class aircraft carrier 9, built by the United States in the late 1990s, and named after Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States. Reagan, the first former US President to name a navy ship while still alive, died a year after the carrier began service. Since then, the carrier has become a symbol of the President, following Reagan’s motto of “strength for peace”. This is indeed a viable idea. Powerful combat weapons patrolling the sea, especially in conflict zones, can enhance the country’s deterrence and highlight America’s military strength. The ship is 332.85 meters long, 78.34 meters wide, has a deck area of 18,000 square meters, displaces 97,000 tons of water, rises 20 stories above the waterline, stands as high as the Empire State Building and can reach speeds of 35 miles per hour. The ship carries 85 aircraft of various types and can accommodate 6,000 crew members. Equipped with two nuclear reactor engines, the Reagan can run continuously for 20 years without refueling. The ship has enough food to feed 6,000 soldiers for three months. The service period is 50 years. Equipped with all the latest technology, the carrier can house 85 fighter jets at a cost of $4.5 billion. The Ronald Reagan is not a zero anymore, it’s a great project. As long as authorized by the President of the United States, personnel can deploy the carrier’s battle group anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>Along with the high technology of the Reagan is the caution of the personnel involved, whose work is both a glory and a constraint. This is also the most dangerous working environment. The soldiers are trained in the most rigorous way, and no small mistakes that might lead to disaster are allowed. At the heart of the operation was the 400 crew on deck, who had to follow the flow of the jet engines, and the first lesson was to put up with the noise. Others, such as aircraft controllers, need to coordinate their work, fold up the aircraft, put it in the right place, and stretch the limited space to the limit. At the same time, maintenance and oil is also an essential link, work is extremely busy, often need to do two things at once, both sides have to grasp, always tracking the dynamics of each aircraft. Frequent landings lead to busy ground crews shuttling back and forth at a controlled time. The master maneuvers this most delicate instrument, like a perfect ballet. In order to ensure the safety of personnel and distinguish the work of various departments, the soldiers changed into rainbow clothing to ensure bright colors, so as to quickly identify the crew.</p>
<p>Without the longest runway, the crew USES wind and propellers to help the plane take off, allowing it to accelerate for a short time. Landing was even riskier, reaching speeds of up to 150 miles per hour before landing, and landing on a mother ship that swayed with the waves was even more difficult, with constant and deadly pressure. At this point, partners need to cooperate, measure the Angle of the landing, to ensure that the blocking line hook, this is the end of a landing.</p>
<p>The following is the question of supplies. The Reagan is powered by two nuclear reactors at the bottom, which work with turbine engines and provide enough power to power a city of 100,000 people. The equipment can run for 20 years, but the weekly replenishment (supplies, fuel, parts) on board is essential. The ships must maintain a constant speed and a safe distance of 160 feet for three to six hours. First, a rope was thrown to transport pallets of supplies, then fuel was added through a hose. The safety team is particularly important here, keeping an eye on the process in case one of the crew’s clothes gets hooked or the locks snap.</p>
<p>To sum up, we can accuse the United States of inhumanity in other places, but the United States is the undisputed king of technology, as evidenced by the super carrier Ronald Reagan and the supporting fighter system. The hope is that the carrier, like its motto, will exist to protect peace, not to threaten other countries by force.</p>

        <p>Generation War</p>
<p>In war, the people come first, then the nation, then the country. So all the talk of war is about people.<br>World war ii is too vague a topic, but the film from the perspective of five different types of German youth, in a small stage show the cruelty of war.<br>Five people, five choices, five experiences, and five endings.<br>Five young men. A pair of brothers, a mature and steady brother and a timid brother, a female nurse who has just passed the examination, a young woman who works in a bar and a Jew.<br>The two brothers joined the army, and the nurse went to the field hospital. A few good friends then celebrated the night before they left and agreed to get together again at Christmas. They were laughing and having fun, defying curfews. They feel fearless, too optimistic about war and too simplistic about human nature.<br>One of the great little details of the miniseries is that it marks the distance from Berlin before it gets anywhere. This corresponds to the young people saying “see you in Berlin at Christmas” before saying goodbye.<br>On July 10, 1941, the battle of Leningrad began.<br>First, the brothers, who went to opposite extremes.<br>Brother will ham is the main narrator of the film, which opens as a second lieutenant in greyhound company. He was a typical German, fearless and eager to give his country everything he had. Full of passion and energy, he is always the center of the crowd and a strategic leader. In his mind, war makes men mature.<br>His strength came from his belief that Hitler could lead Germany to a brighter future. So at first he looked down upon his brother who wanted to escape the war.<br>But as the battle lines stretched, from 1941 to 1943, will began to wonder what he was fighting for. He discovered the nature of war, he knew it was wrong. He could not answer to the germans or the soviets, nor could he confide in his soldiers. In the end, he became the deserter he had most hated.<br>Then will found the meaning of life – to live. He can’t be a hero, and he doesn’t want to be a pig in a slaughterhouse.<br>In contrast to his emotional brother, brother Fred hamm is so rational that he is probably the most lucid person in the show. Because he reads so many books, he looks further than his friends. He read the French poet rambo. Rimbaud is a religious icon whose poetry is full of arcanism and who has no contempt for hypocrisy. Rimbaud also participated in the Paris society and wrote an ode to the uprising on March 18, 871. Fried inherited the poet’s vulnerability, and he understood the fascist plot, but could not dissuade anyone around him.<br>He hated war, but perhaps he hated his own weakness even more.<br>So he was reluctant to shoot in the early days of the Soviet invasion.<br>But Fried is very adaptable. His brother will have doubts, will give up because of compassion, and he won’t. He abandons compassion, and in order to survive, he chooses to become a machine that can only carry out the orders of his superiors.<br>This confirms what he said before the war, that war brings out the bad in people.<br>He thought a Nazi lieutenant colonel had killed a jewish girl and was crying.<br>He has fallen.<br>Maybe at some point he wanted to return to the light. But germans, and even his parents, seem to regard his return from injury as a humiliation. Under pressure, he returned to the battlefield.<br>In 1945, scattered German soldiers on the eastern front began to return from various fronts, and friedham and several national stormtroopers met the soviets on their way home.<br>A few hot-blooded young men wanted to die for their country.<br>“You are children,” said friedham finally. “the russians will send you home.”<br>Then he ran into a Russian bullet and used his body to tell the young men behind him that the war was over.<br>A good soldier is weak most of the time, but strong occasionally.<br>At last he was truly brave, and then he collapsed on the eve of peace.<br>The reason why he left the birth to his children was that his character had not changed from beginning to end. Laughably, the elder brother has always been the mature brother, and the younger brother has always been the weak and kind brother.<br>Will fled because he had a sense of responsibility. He knew that it was wrong to attack the Soviet union, but his soldiers would be condemned if he stopped. His brother became the executioner not because he was sensible, but because he was afraid, he did not want to die, can only to adapt to the harsh environment, then he lived a muddle, death in his release.<br>Maybe it is a kind of atonement, when he did not save the little girl of the Soviet union, finally found the result here.<br>Then there was Sally, the war nurse. She was the youngest, eager to serve her country, and she had the childlike innocence of a child who silently loved will.<br>Sometimes, however, the child’s unconscious actions are even more brutal.<br>At first she was hopeful, compassionate, and distressed by the soldiers’ injuries. But her “flower of evil” also blossomed during the war, and she became a qualified field nurse, turning on jewish women and even betraying Soviet girls who had helped her.<br>Her fear and doubt in the face of the war is very small, I see from her is not vicious, but a weak girl with layers of cocoon to protect themselves. Pathetic and pathetic. She represents the vast majority of ordinary people, muddled with the leader’s pace, not to think why, also dare not resist.<br>Fortunately, the human nature of the good, finally returned to the good, in order to sonny gave up the retreat, finally survived.<br>And Greta.<br>Greta is a contradictory individual. She is so beautiful that her friends think she will be a star. But the cruel war could not bear an innocent and useless woman. She traded the only thing she had, beauty, for the chance for her jewish boyfriend to escape, for an empty life.<br>Her love affair with a young Jew, victor, was Platonic, not carnal. She really loved him, across race and across national faith. She lives both fully and confusedly.<br>On April 11, 1945, she was executed for defeatism.<br>Did not see the dawn, no lover drunk smoked kiss.<br>She died with a pale skin. At least in the end she is clean, like a ray of moonlight, according to the broken heart.<br>I can’t tell if she’s wrong. Chastity and flesh are sometimes worthless in the face of life. In giving her a chance, she may yet seduce for the sake of her future with her lover<br>On May 8, 1945, Germany surrendered.<br>In the devastated streets, victor, a Jew, was free to walk, and he would no longer be humiliated by racial discrimination.<br>The family lost their sewing shop at kristallnacht and life took a nosedib. He lost almost everything in the war, which shows the impotence of small groups in the face of large forces. He suffered most from a broken heart. Victor knew that he and the germans are not different, but he had to rely on his girlfriend’s body for escape, he wandered all the way, save also be saved. He was the one who truly saw the warmth of the world.<br>He returned to the prewar bar and lifted the lid. He didn’t play the piano because the beautiful girl who danced was dead. He lost the love of his life.<br>Without rock music and baked cakes, without tearful hugs and kisses, the three men who were alive approached each other with distancing precaution.<br>They toasted their dead old friends and brothers.<br>The wounds of the war are hard to heal, and every young face in the camera has read all the sorrows of the world, becoming vicissitudes and confusion. World war ii is over, and then what? Where do they go from here?<br>I don’t know if they will meet again. They might get together and talk about their wishful thinking, but maybe they won’t, because it will only remind them of those four bloody years.<br>After I read it, I felt very painful. Sometimes my personal fate paled before the war. It’s not anybody who’s wrong. It’s the war. It’s everybody.<br>May there be no war in the world, and may all people make the right decisions when the chips are down.</p>

<p>I had very little knowledge of python and would only issue a few simple instructions. After the later learning, I was surprised to find that python has powerful third-party programs that can help with different types of data. The power of python can be clearly seen from the mind map I drew below.</p>

<p>NumPy:<br>NumPy, the basic package for python scientific computing, provides the following functionality (but not limited to it) :<br>(1) fast and efficient multidimensional array object ndarray<br>(2) functions for performing element-level calculations on arrays and performing mathematical operations directly on arrays<br>(3) tools for reading and writing arrow-based data sets on a hard disk<br>(4) linear algebra operation, Fourier transform, and random number generation<br>(5) tools for integrating C, C++, and Fortran code into python</p>

        <p>Question:</p>
<p>There were 100 people on an island, with five red eyes and 95 blue eyes. The island has three strange religious rules.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>They can’t look in the mirror and see the color of their eyes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They can’t tell each other what color their eyes are.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once someone knows he has red eyes, he must commit suicide that night.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One day a traveler came to the island. Because do not know the rules here, so he and the whole island people together when the carnival, accidentally said a word: you here have red eyes.<br>Question: given that the people on this island are smart enough to make rigorous logical reasoning, what happens on the island?</p>
<p>Analysis process:</p>
<p>First of all, I felt a little confused, because I could not reason rationally according to the visual test conditions. Then I read the answer immediately, but I still felt it was a little incredible. So I began to reason from the simplest one, and finally understood the answer.</p>
<p>Condition: you have red eyes here</p>
<p>1 red eye +99 blue eyes</p>
<p>Day 1:<br>Red eye perspective: 0 red eyes +99 blue eyes, identify yourself as red eyes, commit suicide the first night<br>Blue eye perspective: 1 red eye +98 blue eyes. I don’t know if I have red eyes, but if I have red eyes, I won’t commit suicide on the first night<br>Result: 1 red eye commits suicide, 99 blue eyes are ok</p>
<p>Conclusion: when only one red eyes, the red eyes will be on the first night confirmed that he is the only red eyes, blue eyes will be on the first day later confirmed that the crowd is only one red eye, so the red eyes after suicide, suspicion (if he was red eyes) with blue eyes is over, and sure you are blue eyes (all blue eyes)<br>2 red eyes plus 98 blue eyes</p>
<p>Day 1:<br>Red eye perspective: 1 red eye +98 blue eyes, confirm 1 red eye, but do not confirm whether they are red eyes<br>Blue eye Angle: 2 red eyes +97 blue eyes identify 2 red eyes, but do not identify themselves as red eyes<br>Result: no suicide the first night</p>
<p>Day two: here begins the premise that everyone knows there is more than one red eye in the crowd<br>Red eye perspective: 1 red eye +98 blue eyes, confirming that there are only 2 red eyes in the crowd<br>Blue eye Angle: 2 red eyes +97 blue eyes<br>Result: two red eyes committed suicide on the second night</p>
<p>Conclusion: when only two red eyes, two red eyes will confirm that he’s on the second night red eyes, blue eyes will be on the evening of the next day after confirmed the crowd has two red eyes, so the red eyes after suicide, suspicion (if he was red eyes) with blue eyes is over, and sure you are blue eyes (all blue eyes)<br>3 red eyes +97 blue eyes</p>
<p>Day 1:<br>Red eye Angle: 2 red eyes +97 blue eyes, confirm 2 red eyes, but do not know whether they are red eyes<br>Blue eye Angle: 3 red eyes +96 blue eyes, confirming 3 red eyes, but not knowing whether they are red eyes<br>Result: no suicide the first night</p>
<p>Day two: here begins the premise that everyone knows there is more than one red eye in the crowd<br>Red eye Angle: 2 red eyes +97 blue eyes, confirm 2 red eyes, but do not know whether they are red eyes<br>Blue eye Angle: 3 red eyes +96 blue eyes, confirming 3 red eyes, but not knowing whether they are red eyes<br>Result: no suicide the next night</p>
<p>Day 3: here begins the premise that everyone knows there are more than two red eyes in the crowd<br>Red eye perspective: 2 red eyes +97 blue eyes, confirm 2 red eyes, know that they are red eyes<br>Blue eye Angle: 3 red eyes +96 blue eyes, confirming 3 red eyes, but not knowing whether they are red eyes<br>Result: the third night 3 red eyes commit suicide</p>
<p>Conclusion: when only three red eyes, three red eyes will be on the third night confirmed he is red eyes, blue eyes will be on the third day later confirmed the crowd has three red eye, so the red eyes after suicide, suspicion (if he was red eyes) with blue eyes is over, and sure you are blue eyes (all blue eyes)</p>
<p>​                                         This question was from: Terence Chi-Shen Tao</p>
<p><strong>When you have n red eyes in the crowd, 100-n blue eyes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Red eyes see n-1 red eyes, blue eyes see n red eyes (always blue eyes see 1 more red eyes)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Red eyes will commit suicide on the NTH night (suicide condition: no one commits suicide before the NTH night)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Blue eyes will commit suicide on the n+1 night (suicide condition: no one commits suicide before the n+1 night)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Final Results:</strong><br><strong>On the fifth night all five people with red eyes will kill themselves</strong></p>
<p>My own feelings:</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes saying nothing can lead to the best outcome</strong>. If the red-eyed and the blue-eyed are not to blame, who is?</p>
<p>Eventually they’ll kill the traveler first.</p>

<p>​                       <em>A burning portrait of a woman</em></p>
<p>When I finished watching, my mind went blank. I wanted to cry, but I wasn’t that sad. As I walked slowly down the stairs, I looked back. I was sorry that Eurydice was not standing behind me in her wedding dress.</p>
<p>Here want to borrow the title of a Korean dramas called ghost, lonely and brilliant god, is the only phrase I think of now.</p>
<p>Female painter with all the wealth came to an island, there were marrying girls and unmarried maids on the island. The girl’s name is Airos. Her sister committed suicide by jumping off a cliff, and she had to marry a man she didn’t know at all. Her family needed a portrait, so painter Marian came.</p>
<p>They walked along the beach during the day, the waves coming up in layers and Airos running against the wind. She longed for freedom, but she was afraid of loneliness. She has a childlike innocence, stubbornly standing still, unwilling to move out of her comfort zone, but when she really has a sweetheart,she would be brave enough to kiss her lover .</p>
<p>The profile of her face was cold, even fierce, and the corners of her mouth went down stiffly, as if she did not want to mingle. But actually is also the soft little girl child, talks a song to follow you.</p>
<p>Marian is more mature by comparison. She had a neutral face with a boyish smile. She jumped into the water to pick up her picture frame.</p>
<p>They spent twelve days together.</p>
<p>The first seven days were a trial in disguise. During the day they went for a walk and talked with a false heart. Maryann tells Airos about the beauty of a foreign land, like guilt or the comfort of a reluctant heart. At night ,Marian painted under a candlestick, creating a stiff, aesthetic portrait.</p>
<p>They are hedgehogs, testing each other’s intentions. Fear of being hurt.</p>
<p>Five days later, Marian got to know Airos again. She destroyed the old painting and promised Airos a new painting with life. They finally had a chance to  know each other.</p>
<p>There really isn’t much dialogue. It’s almost everyday. They look at each other, in the lonely empty island to find a lost love. An unfortunate woman who has had a miscarriage, a bride who has been pushed by fate, they also desire to be loved.</p>
<p>The bonfire party is a turning point in the whole episode, with everyone singing hymns and heavy shadows lit by flames. Airos ‘s skirt caught fire and was stunning.</p>
<p>Hymns are sung, songs from hell, empty, like a funeral song. They looked at each other over the distant, shrill music, tentative and timid.</p>
<p>Eventually they kissed.</p>
<p>The biggest question in the whole movie is why Orpheus turns back?</p>
<p>Different from rules and missing. He chose the memory of Eurydice. It’s not the choice to be a lover, it’s the choice to be a poet.</p>
<p>“Turn around.” Perhaps Eurydice said it herself.</p>
<p>I remembered the movie *”He is A Dragon*” I had seen before, which told a similar story. It was probably that the girl was swept away by the dragon on her wedding night and fell in love with the dragon who did not want to hurt others on the island. At last, the girl returned to her hometown to break the engagement, and the dragon also controlled his fierce nature. They are together as a matter of course.</p>
<p>The same island, the same lonely love, Marian and Airos are doomed to be together. Maryann is not a dragon, without the divine power to destroy heaven and earth. She is just an imperfect little painter, unable to protect her beloved.</p>
<p>Plus their gender. I don’t understand why gays have been rejected by mainstream culture. Gay romance movies rarely seem to end well. The people who love each other are separated eventually.</p>
<p>They are so good, but not with a lifetime.</p>
<p>In an age when women can’t paint men naked, two girls can’t be together, can’t even give an everlasting promise.</p>
<p>They hold hands, they kiss, they lie in bed for one last comfort.</p>
<p>They only had twelve days, thirteen was the devil’s number, and twelve was the perfect ending.</p>
<p>It’s time to call it a day.</p>
<p>Maryann leaves, and Airos stopped her.</p>
<p>“Turn around.” This was the command and the last prayer.</p>
<p>So the painter looked back and saw what she had seen many times as dreams mingled with reality. The beautiful flower-like Airos stood at the foot of the stairs in her white wedding dress and seemed ready to leap into her arms.</p>
<p>Eurydice called to Orpheus to keep her in his heart.</p>
<p>The burning fire snapped out.</p>
<p>The girl no longer belonged to her.</p>
<p>Then came the painter’s last two meetings with Airos. One was at a painting show. Marian looked at the woman with the baby in the picture .She smiled.</p>
<p>She probably still happy, like the girl found a happy home, she wished her.</p>
<p>The dog-eared book in Airos’ hand was a gift from Marian. The dog-eared one is page 28, and there is a picture of a naked woman.</p>
<p>That’s Marian’s self-portrait.</p>
<p>The second time in the theater, the two sat on opposite sides. Marian looked at Airos, but this time their eyes did not meet.</p>
<p>In the last three minutes, a close-up of Airos’ face, her eyes fixed on the stage, tears trickling down her cheeks. She knew she was there, she knew her former lover was staring at her with tender, forgiving eyes. But she did not turn her head. She turned her face firmly to the other side and smiled.</p>
<p>In the background is Vivati ‘s “the four seasons, the summer.” there is no sun or beach, just testy wind and rain, not the unwelcoming heat. But as Marian says, it’s vital, it’s new.</p>
<p>The married girl smiled in the storm, the red light shone on her face, and she seemed to be melting. Just like the recurring candle in the film, the candle burned fiercely all night, and finally only the last piece of moist candle tears remained.</p>
<p>It was a great tragedy, but I didn’t cry.</p>
<p>Through thousands of water, they are doomed to meet again. But maybe, just maybe, they will pass each other in the streets of Milan after countless years, their skirts raised in each other’s hearts left a bright color, but they will not look back.</p>

<p><strong>Some questions and their solutions</strong></p>
<p>Part. 1</p>
<p> <strong>Calculate monthly payments for a loan</strong></p>
<p>（This question was from the website <a href="https://www.chegg.com/homework-help/questions-and-answers/fruin-10-write-python-program-uses-function-calculates-returns-monthly-payments-loan-funct-q42914218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chegg Study</a>）</p>
<p>Write a function that calculates and returns the monthly payments for a loan. This function accepts three parameters in the exact order (principal, annual_interest_rate, duration):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>principal: The total amount of loan. Assume that the principal is a positive floating point number.</p>
</li>
<li><p>annual_interest_rate: This is the percent interest rate per year. Assume that annual_interest_rate is a floating point number. (Notice that 4.5 means that the interest rate is 4.5 percent per year.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>duration: number of years to pay the loan back. Assume that duration is a positive integer.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate the amount of monthly payment for the loan you should use the following equation</p>
<p><a href="file:///C:\Users\josie\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml20048\wps1.jpg">img</a> </p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>r is the monthly interest rate (should be calculated by first dividing the annual_interest_rate by 100 and then divide the result by 12 to make it monthly). Notice that if the interest rate is equal to zero then the above equation will give you a Zero Division Error. In that case you should use the following equation:</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="file:///C:\Users\josie\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml20048\wps2.jpg">img</a> </p>
<ul>
<li>n is the total number of monthly payments for the entire duration of the loan (Notice that n is equal to loan duration in years multiplied by 12).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your function should return the monthly payment as a floating point number.</p>
<p>Example: if your function is called with the following parameters:</p>
<p><code>(1000.0,4.5,5)</code></p>
<p>Then it should return a floating point number:</p>
<p><code>18.643019241516996</code></p>
<p>Remember that you are not asked to print anything. So, your function should just <strong><em>\</em>return**</strong> the monthly payments. You do not need to call your function, it will automatically be called and tested for correctness with the test cases we provide. You only need to write one function and we will test your program with the first function that appears in your code. So, if you want to write more than one function to help you solve the problem remember to embed the helper functions inside the first function.</p>

<p>To sum up,l would like to talk about my feeling. Sometimes computer science is a heavy burden for me as  I was terrible at coding (like VB) , and I didn’t know much about it. However the study of grammar made me feel a little more confident because each step is closely related,  I can derive the final formula step by step.</p>
<p>If we meet problems,we can:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take each step individually and identify the problem</li>
<li>See what the final output is and compare it to the correct result</li>
<li>Another way to think about it. For example, if you can’t do it with the ‘break’ statement, try the ‘continue’ statement</li>
<li>Never lose heart!!!</li>
</ol>

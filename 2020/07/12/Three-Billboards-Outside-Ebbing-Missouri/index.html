        <p><strong>This film is included in my thematic study. But because girls who are sexually abused in the film are used as leads, it was not included in the study.</strong><br><strong>I want to recommend this film to more people, to make people understand justice and love.</strong></p>
<p>Three Billboards Outside Ebbing</p>
<p>After watching the film, I found that the girl received sexual assault is only a trigger, which is the theme throughout the film, the beginning and end of the mother’s revenge.</p>
<p>The story takes place in a remote town, where Mill’s daughter is raped and murdered, but the local police do nothing, so the angry mother rents three billboards in the town to reveal the useless sheriff, hoping to let sheriff Willoughby continue to investigate the criminal.</p>
<p>Mother Mill is an independent female hero, because her daughter’s death is indirectly caused by her, so she vowed to find the murderer. She is eloquent, has a strong thinking ability, and has a very strong personality, but it is precisely because of such excessive sensibility that she will do extremely irrational things.</p>
<p>Constable Dixon has a strong propensity for violence and the same emotional disregard for things that should be used mentally. He seems to be the archetypal bad guy, mambo, racist, and closet.</p>
<p>Sheriff Willoughby is the most rational person in the play. He has the emotional part, but he has a heavy view of the big picture and will consider the possible result first. Although he is foul-mouthed, he has been working for the townsfolk. His terminal cancer makes him feel inadequate to deal with mill’s daughter’s case.</p>
<p>The play USES several threes, three billboards put up by Mill, three letters left by Willoughby after his suicide, three members of the leading group, and three outbreaks of conflict. Together, they explain good and evil, and justice in the eyes of ordinary people. The rape case is an imprint that brings out the pursuit of so-called justice among people of different classes.</p>
<p>At first, Mill thinks that both the murderer and the police are evil. They represent the evil men who rape and kill women and the bourgeoisie who look on coldly. Then the priest and dentist who spoke for the sheriff became accomplices – because they and the police belonged to a “group,” a group of bystanders with no help or empathy. However, as the story progresses, her attitude towards the police changes, and she feels guilty for her aggressiveness and insubordination. At this time, the image of the police in her heart changes to some extent.</p>
<p>The evil in Dixon’s eyes is first the reactionary Mill, and then the advertiser who helps Mill for money. His good idea comes from his boss Dixon, when Dixon dies of suicide, his anger and despair make him beat the advertiser, and then he is fired by the new sheriff.</p>
<p>The second conflict of the story is the death of Willoughby, the cancer is about to destroy him completely, so he shot his own life, from the cloth covering his head to ask his family not to open it and put flowers beside the left letter can be seen that he is a very sensitive man. He left three letters to his wife, Mill and Dixon, and it was these letters that changed the character’s conception of good and evil.</p>
<p>The letter to Mill explains that in a very emotional move, he helped her pay for the next month’s advertisement and encouraged her not to give up on finding the murderer, saying that he was sorry he had not found the prisoner.<br>Then billboards are burned, what glimmers of hope are extinguished, and Mill, in his agony, torches the police station.</p>
<p>The third conflict was in the burning police station, where Dixon was reading Willoughby’s letter. He understood the sheriff’s painstaking efforts at this time, in the fire to save mill’s daughter’s scroll. Obviously, he knows that Mill started the fire, but instead of using violence to solve the problem, he wants to do something for Mill’s daughter with a last bit of kindness.</p>
<p>The last little man, a retired soldier with a cheeky smile, was the only one in the whole play who was as bad as his bones. He bragged in the bar about raping and killing girls, and even came to mock Mill after seeing the billboard, wishing he were the devil who raped and killed her daughter. Although Dixon’s hard-won cortical tissue shows that the soldier was in Iraq at the time of the crime, his actions cannot be forgiven, so at the end, Mill and Dixon, two enemies, finally put aside their prejudices and decide to go together to find the soldier.<br>It’s an open ending. They may or may not be outlaws who kill soldiers.</p>
<p> No matter what, justice is always there.</p>
